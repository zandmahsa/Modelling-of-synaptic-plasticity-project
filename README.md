# Modelling-of-synaptic-plasticity-project


In this project, we aim to **classify handwritten digits from the N-MNIST datase**t, an event-based variant of the traditional MNIST dataset. The N-MNIST dataset contains asynchronous events captured by event-based vision sensors, which record changes in pixel intensity. We implement a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) using the BindsNET framework and employ two learning algorithms: spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and Reward-modulated STDP (R-STDP).


The models will be evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy and F1-score. This project aims to explore the potential of SNNs in real-time, event-driven tasks, particularly in the classification of handwritten digits.
